# Technology Base Case

**Item 0** - The artifact is available at this link¹. For this activity, the trello tool was used using a kanban model with the help of a checklist to monitor the development of the project. The risks of the tasks were defined by colors where green corresponds to low risk, yellow means medium risk and red means high risk.

**Item 1** - The database chosen was the data relating to Rossmann store sales available at this link².The choice of this dataset was motivated by the requirements proposed in the challenge, which include the need to work with a database containing more than 100,000 records and that is related to a specific business problem. This dataset fully meets these criteria, presenting a considerable volume of data (over 1 million records) and being focused on sales analysis.

**Item 2** - The file was loaded using the platform's import module. Some descriptive metrics were automatically added after load. Below, the image shows the data pipeline.

**Item 3** - After sending the static file, the platform automatically catalogs the data assets. A dashboard containing a small exploratory analysis of the data was made with the Metabase³.

**Item 4** - The quality report was generated using the great-expectations library and can be accessed through this link⁴.
